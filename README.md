# Pygame Weather app

This app will fetch the weather based on your location and get the weather for the next week.  
This is my first real Pygame app, do not expect exceptional structure or code.

### Note
Licenses images and fonts were used for development which are not attached in this version.  
Although, I have commented out code within the app to have the original licensed font settings included and their names if you want to implement them yourself.  
Just add them to a 'fonts' folder in the root directory and plant them there.  
Likewise, the licensed images were replaced with single or gradient colours. You can replace these easier by rewriting the files in 'img/bg' then day or night.  
Keep in mind though that these images must be 317x421 px or it wont fit the screen.

## Credit
The weather icons are from Persona4, all credit goes to Atlus Co., Ltd and Sega Corporation. I take no credit for the images.
